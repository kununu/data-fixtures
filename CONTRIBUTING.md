# Contributing

Contributions are more than **welcome**.

We accept contributions via Pull Requests on [GitHub](https://github.com/kununu/data-fixtures).

## Pull Requests

- **[kununu Coding Standards](https://github.com/kununu/code-tools/blob/main/dist/php-cs-fixer.php.dist)**
  - The kununu coding standards are an extension of the [PSR-2](https://github.com/php-fig/fig-standards/blob/master/accepted/PSR-2-coding-style-guide.md). 
  - Check out our kununu Coding Standards library, [kununu/code-tools](https://github.com/kununu/code-tools) for more details.
    - In development mode the package is already a dependency that expose commands that you can use to meet our standards.

- **Add tests!**
  - To ensure a high quality code base, your code patch can't be accepted if it does not have tests.

- **Document any change in behaviour**
  - Make sure that the `README.md` and any other relevant documentation files are kept up-to-date.

- **Consider our release cycle**
  - Since we're using semantic versioning ([SemVer v2.0.0](http://semver.org/)), changes to the API must be done with great consideration, and prevented if at all possible.

- **Create feature branches**
  - `main` is the stable branch, create a new branch for each feature.

- **One pull request per feature**
  - If you want to do more than one thing, send multiple pull requests.

- **Be respectful**
  - Be excellent to other contributors. See our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

**Happy coding**!
